My focus is on automation, performance, observability, and reliability to support one of the world’s leading cybersecurity products.\n\nSite Reliability Engineer  Relativity\nDecember 2023 - June 2025\n\nI am responsible for RelativityOne (e-discovery product) availability monitoring, which is based on NewRelic Scripted Browser monitor running JavaScript Selenium test to verify whether core product functionalities are available for end users.\nI specialize in designing, developing, and maintaining automated releases and deployment processes using custom-built GitHub Actions workflows. My role involves ensuring seamless and efficient deployment processes across all cloud-hosted tenants. I work with both Python and PowerShell scripts to programmatically perform operations needed to achieve the goal. As a result I have implemented Selenium test versioning and the ability to easily upgrade or rollback our availability test on production instances.\n\nOperations Specialist  Bosch\nAugust 2023 - November 2023\n\nI am developing PowerShell automation scripts which are triggered on monitoring host via Windows Task Scheduler to cover repetitive daily tasks. Usually automation scripts are integrated with SPLUNK alerting system to process data generated by PowerShell and notify operations team about captured issues or coming manual duties.\n\nTechnical Engineer  Atos\nJuly 2021 - July 2023\n\nI am designing and building automations for as many repetitive tasks as possible using PowerShell scripting. To be able to achieve the goal I have developed many PowerShell modules related to necessary data transformations, which are required in every report or dataset processed. I take care of code speed execution, as well as the optimization of my device resource consumption. Understanding of general concept of multithreading and multiprocessing accordingly with PowerShell available techniques allowed me to speed up operations done within the script and make a better use of computer resources. As a result I capable of delivering very complex reports everyday, on customer’s order, where combining data from different tools is required.\n\nIT Network Administrator, Freelance\nJune 2019 - June 2021\n\nI design, build and modernize complete IT infrastructure. I am responsible for both software and hardware in environments up to 50 users.\nDuring my daily work I cover following areas:\n\nNetwork physical and logical topology design, configuration and management - Cisco hardware as well as virtualized solutions like pfSense routing software\nActive Directory domains design, configuration and management\nStorage and backup solutions design, configuration and management\nVirtualization solutions design, configuration and management mainly based on Microsoft Hyper-V\nDevice monitoring and remote access design, configuration and management"

Supports both Light and Dark Github themes, great for extending\n\n\nInvestment\nThe Investment project is a Python based, containerized tool designed to automate and streamline the management and analysis of investment portfolios. At its core, the project provides robust functionality for handling investment configurations and updating fund quotations, ensuring that financial data is consistently up-to-date and accurate. Users can quickly configure investments, retrieve and update quotations, and visualize the results on Grafana dashboards. One application instance can handle many investment owners with multiple investment wallets for each owner."
