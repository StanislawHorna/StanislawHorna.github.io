Welcome to my personal website repository! This project hosts my resume, available as a GitHub Pages site and in PDF format.

## About

Resume is rendered on GitHub Actions runner using [Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev) - Open source scientific and technical publishing system.

Information about me are stored in a single file ([`RESUME.md`](/RESUME.md)),
which is being used to generate both HTML and PDF version of Resume.

As a starting point how to work with Quarto I was looking into [ToKnow-ai/quarto-resume-template](https://github.com/ToKnow-ai/quarto-resume-template),
to understand basic behavior and dependencies related to work with Quarto, to later implement my own variation of this approach.
